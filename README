Project Alexandria aims to make books in the public domain accessible, beautiful and easy to manage.

Accessible:
- file formats for many devices and screen sizes
- easy to find and download

Beautiful:
- page layout and typography that supports the reading experience
- beautiful to look at

Easy to manage:
- one master file format from which all other formats are derived
- easy collaboration and errata contribution via a distributed version control system

We very much like the work of Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/).
Project Alexandria does not compete with PG in regard to providing and preserving as many books as possible.

We intend to create fewer eBooks that are joyful to read.

This repository does not yet contain finished books or production ready code.
We use it to structure our efforts and to have the proposed solution approaches (with examples) in one place.
